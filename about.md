# {{ page.title }}

I am a mathematical engineer and developer. I work as a data visualization consultant, implementing interactive data visualization projects for web platforms. I am also author of the book [Mastering D3.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-d3js) published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com) in August 2014.

My process of creating a compelling data visualization usually involves understanding the communication need, data processing and analysis, information design and crafting the visualization itself. Feel free to <a href="mailto:pnavarrc@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you have a project that you would like to bring to life.
